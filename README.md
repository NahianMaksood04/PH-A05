1. **Difference between getElementById, getElementsByClassName, and querySelector / querySelectorAll**
   `getElementById` selects a single element by its unique ID. `getElementsByClassName` selects all elements with a given class. `querySelector` selects the first element that matches a CSS selector, while `querySelectorAll` selects all elements that match a CSS selector.

2. **Creating and inserting a new element into the DOM**
   A new element is created using `createElement` and then inserted into the DOM using `appendChild` or `insertBefore` methods.

3. **Event Bubbling**
   Event bubbling is the process where an event triggered on an element propagates upward through its parent elements to the document root.

4. **Event Delegation and its usefulness**
   Event delegation is attaching a single event listener to a parent element to handle events from its child elements. It reduces the number of event listeners and improves performance.

5. **Difference between preventDefault() and stopPropagation()**
   `preventDefault()` stops the default browser action for an event. `stopPropagation()` prevents the event from bubbling up to parent elements.
