1. What is the difference between **getElementById, getElementsByClassName, and querySelector / querySelectorAll**?

getElementById selects a single element by its unique ID. getElementsByClassName selects all elements with a given class.
querySelector selects the first element that matches a CSS selector.
querySelectorAll selects all elements that match a CSS selector.


2. How do you **create and insert a new element into the DOM**?
   
A new element is created using createElement and then inserted into the DOM using appendChild.


3. What is **Event Bubbling** and how does it work?
   
Event bubbling is the process where an event triggered on an element upward through its parent elements to the document root.


4. What is **Event Delegation** in JavaScript? Why is it useful?
   
Event delegation is attaching a single event listener to a parent element to handle events from its child elements. It reduces the number of event listeners and improves performance.


5. What is the difference between **preventDefault() and stopPropagation()** methods?
   
preventDefault() stops the default browser action for an event. stopPropagation() prevents the event from bubbling up to parent elements.
